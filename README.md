# @esroyo/deno-bump-workspaces

> A tool for upgrading Deno workspace packages using conventional commits

[![ci](https://github.com/esroyo/bump-workspaces/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/esroyo/bump-workspaces/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/esroyo/bump-workspaces/graph/badge.svg?token=9Y9L5BV24U)](https://codecov.io/gh/esroyo/bump-workspaces)

This tool detects necessary version upgrades for workspaces packages using
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and
creates a PR. Compatible with the original
[@deno/bump-workspaces](https://github.com/denoland/bump-workspaces).

# Try it

Run this command with `--dry-run` flag in your Deno project and see what this
command does:

```sh
deno run -A jsr:@esroyo/deno-bump-workspaces/cli --dry-run
```

This works with both:

- **Workspace repositories**: Projects with a `workspace` field in `deno.json`
- **Single-package repositories**: Projects with `name` and `version` fields in
  `deno.json`

# How it works

The tool works with both workspace and single-package repositories:

**For workspace repositories:**

- Read `deno.json` and its "workspace" field. Read `deno.json` of each workspace
  package.

**For single-package repositories:**

- Read `deno.json` with "name" and "version" fields (no "workspace" field
  needed).

**Common workflow:**

- Collect the git commit messages between the latest tag and the current branch.
- Calculate the necessary updates for each package. (See the below table for
  what version upgrades are performed for each conventional commit tag.)
- Create and print the release note.
- Stop here if `--dry-run` specified, and continue if not.
- Save necessary updates to each `deno.json`.
- Create a new branch `release-YYYY-MM-DD`
- Make git commit the version changes using `GIT_USER_NAME` and `GIT_USER_EMAIL`
  env vars.
- Create a github pull request using `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` env
  vars.
- That's all.

Note: Don't worry if your commits don't completely follow conventional commits.
You can still manually update the PR generated by this tool. The PR body
includes the information about which commits are handled by this tool and which
are not.

# CI set up

Set up the GitHub Actions yaml like the below, and trigger the workflow
manually:

```yaml
name: version_bump

on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  build:
    name: version bump
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15

    steps:
      - name: Clone repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Deno
        uses: denoland/setup-deno@v1

      - name: Run workspaces version bump
        run: |
          git fetch --unshallow origin
          deno run -A jsr:@esroyo/deno-bump-workspaces/cli
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BOT_TOKEN }}
```

## Commit titles

This tool uses the commit titles as the input for detecting which modules and
versions to update. The commit titles need to follow the following format:

```
<tag>(<scopes,...>): <commit message>
```

Some examples are:

```
fix(foo): fix a bug
fix(baz,qux): fix a bug
feat(bar): add a new feature
feat(bar)!: add a breaking feature
chore(foo): clean up
chore(bar): clean up
BREAKING(quux): some breaking change
```

This example results in the following version updates:

| module | version |
| ------ | ------- |
| foo    | patch   |
| bar    | major   |
| baz    | patch   |
| qux    | patch   |
| quux   | major   |

The tool automatically detects following commit tags:

- BREAKING
- feat
- fix
- perf
- docs
- deprecation
- refactor
- test
- style
- chore

You can also mark any commit as breaking by adding `!` after the scope:

- `feat(scope)!: breaking feature` → major version bump
- `fix(scope)!: breaking fix` → major version bump

If a module has `BREAKING` commits or commits with `!`, then `major` version
will be updated. If a module has `feat` commits, `minor` version will be
updated. Otherwise `patch` version will be updated.

| tag         | version |
| ----------- | ------- |
| BREAKING    | major   |
| feat        | minor   |
| fix         | patch   |
| perf        | patch   |
| docs        | patch   |
| deprecation | patch   |
| refactor    | patch   |
| test        | patch   |
| style       | patch   |
| chore       | patch   |

## Scope required tags

The following tags require scope specified because they don't make sense without
scopes. If these tags specified without scopes, they are raised as diagnostics
in README.

- BREAKING
- feat
- fix
- perf
- deprecation

## Wildcard scope

You can use `*` for the scope. That commit affects all the packages in the
workspace. For example:

```
refactor(*): clean up
```

The above commit causes `patch` upgrade to the all packages.

## Unstable updates

You can mark the change only affects the unstable part of the package by using
`scope/unstable` or `unstable/scope`.

```
feat(crypto/unstable): a new unstable feature
BREAKING(crypto/unstable): breaking change to unstable feature
```

If this notation is used, the effect of the commit becomes `patch` no matter
what commit type is used.

# Publishing Modes

The tool supports two publishing modes and works with both workspace and
single-package repositories:

## Workspace Mode (Default)

Creates a single release with all package updates:

```sh
deno run -A jsr:@esroyo/deno-bump-workspaces/cli
```

- Single release note file (`Releases.md`)
- Single pull request with all changes
- Consolidated view of all updates

## Per-Package Mode

Creates individual releases for each package:

```sh
# Basic per-package mode (creates individual tags and release notes by default)
deno run -A jsr:@esroyo/deno-bump-workspaces/cli --publish-mode per-package

# With individual PRs as well
deno run -A jsr:@esroyo/deno-bump-workspaces/cli \
  --publish-mode per-package \
  --individual-prs

# Opt out of defaults using --no-* flags
deno run -A jsr:@esroyo/deno-bump-workspaces/cli \
  --publish-mode per-package \
  --no-individual-release-notes
```

**Note**: For single-package repositories, per-package mode behaves similarly to
workspace mode since there's only one package to release.

### Options

- `--individual-prs`: Create separate PRs for each package (default: `false`)
- `--individual-tags`: Create git tags like `@scope/package@1.2.0` (default:
  `true` in per-package mode)
- `--individual-release-notes`: Create `CHANGELOG.md` in each package directory
  (default: `true` in per-package mode)

All boolean options support `--no-*` flags to override defaults (e.g.,
`--no-individual-tags`).
